Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.

PINT Pin interrupt example

PINT Pin Interrupt events are configured

Press corresponding switches to generate events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example configures "Pin Interrupt 0" to be invoked when K1 is pressed by the user.
The interrupt callback prints "PINT Pin Interrupt 0 event detected". "Pin Interrupt 1" is
is configured to be invoked when K3 is pressed. The interrupt callback prints "PINT Pin Interrupt
1 event detected".
