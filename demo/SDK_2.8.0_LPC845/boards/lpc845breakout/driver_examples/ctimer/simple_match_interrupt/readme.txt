Overview
========
The Simple Match Interrupt project is to demonstrate usage of the SDK CTimer driver with interrupt callback functions
In this example the upon match and IO pin connected to the LED is toggled and the timer is reset, so it would generate a square wave.
With an interrupt callback the match value is changed frequently in such a way that the frequency of the output square wave is increased gradually.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.1
- Keil MDK  5.30
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPC845 Breakout board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
