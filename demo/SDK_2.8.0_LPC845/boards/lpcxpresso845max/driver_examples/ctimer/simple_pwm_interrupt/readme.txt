## Overview
-----------
The Simple PWM Interrupt project is to demonstrate usage of the SDK CTimer driver as a PWM with interrupt callback functions.
In this example an IO pin connected to the LED is used as a PWM output line to generate a PWM signal.
With an interrupt callback the PWM duty cycle is changed frequently in such a way that the LED brightness can be varied.

## Functional Description
-------------------------
In this example, The CTimer module generates a PWM signal.

When start running this example, main routine will initialize clock, pin mux configuration, then configure the CTIMER module and enable interrupt and generate a 2Khz PWM signal. The example uses interrupts to update the PWM duty cycle and LED brightness is varied.

## Toolchain Supported
---------------------
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.50.5
- Keil MDK 5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso 11.2.0

## Hardware Requirements
------------------------
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso845MAX board
- Personal Computer

## Board Settings
------------------------
No special settings are required.

## Run the Project
------------------------
Run the example by performing the following steps:

1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP port(J4 on the 
   LPCXpresso845MAX board).

2. Open a serial terminal in PC(for example PUTTY) with the following settings:
   - 9600 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control

3. Compile and download the program to the target board.
   More information about how to compile and program the project can refer to 

   [Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK](../../../../../docs/Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK.pdf).

4. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the project.

5. Monitor the information on the debug console.

## Expected Result
------------------------
The log below shows example output of the CTimer simple PWM demo using interrupts in the terminal window:
