Overview
========
The usart_interrupt example shows how to use usart transactional API in interrupt way:

In this example, one usart instance connect to PC through, the board will send back all 
characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.

No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
